# R Workshop

This is an R Workshop designed for graduate students in Political Science. In this course, we go over best practices in R, including loading, cleaning, and maintaining data, analysis techniques, and other critical skills that graduate students will employ throughout their careers in academia and other sectors. This workshop has been developed by Adee Weller and Eddy Yeung.

There are three main folders: 
* Tech Workshop
* Fall Sessions
* Spring Sessions

Each folder contains the R or Mathematica code for each of our sessions, any datasets that are required, exercises, problem sets, and solutions. The Spring sessions are designed to be helpful to first-year graduate students at Emory University, as per their needs and requests.

If there are any questions, please contact me and Eddy at: adee.weller@emory.edu and shing.fung.yeung@emory.edu
