# R Workshop

This is an R Workshop designed for graduate students in Political Science. In this course, we go over best practices in R, including loading, cleaning, and maintaining data, analysis techniques, and other critical skills that graduate students will employ throughout their careers in academia and other sectors. This workshop has been developed by Adee Weller and Eddy Yeung.

There are four main folders: 
* Tech Workshop
* Fall Sessions
* January Refresher
* Spring Sessions

Each folder contains the slides for each of our sessions, any datasets that are required, R code, exercises, and problem sets, as well as solutions. The Spring sessions are designed to coordinate with POLS 509 (Linear Models) at Emory University.
